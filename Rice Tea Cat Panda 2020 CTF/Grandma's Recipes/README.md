# Grandma's Recipes

Points : 100

## Description

So Delphine and the GIANt wanted to make a recipe that Delphine's grandma passed down to her. The problem is, her grandma is extremely tech-savvy. In fact, she likes using a Certain Website on the endless Inter-Webs. She says it's very useful for storing her recipes. It'll be kinda hard for Delphine and the GIANt to git her recipes though; they don't know her username. Oh well. But hey, they know that she likes naming things after the Holy Rice Goddess.

I wonder what recipe Delphine and GIANt are making. . .

## Hint

No hints.

## Solving

Delphine needs to **git** her grandma's recipes on a certain website, and she goes by the name of the Holly rice Goddess. So let's a look at
that :

What we want is her recipes here, so look at `meatloaf_recipe.txt` and see what we got :

# A Friend In Need Is A Friend Indeed

Category : Misc

Points : 50

## Description

Hm, I see a lot of potential friends in the midst of that discord, but... one is not like the others; maybe I'll slide into their dms and strike up a conversation about passwords!

## Hint

You had better slide into their dms. I swear if you don't....

Is there a chance... that you already have the solution, right in your ~~mouth~~ I mean ~~fingers~~ I mean hands? ~~I dunno what I'm talking about anymore~~

JD, if that helps any

## Solving

Again, straight forward challenge. First, let's listen to the hint and head up to discord and say `JD` in any channel and a bot will come up
and say something random :

Then let's listen to the other hint, and hit up her DMs to talk her about **passwords**, which means, send her the flag we found in strong password, and see what she responds with :

## Solving

This one is pretty straight forward if you know what you are looking for. And what are we looking for ? A flag, right.
When viewing the text file, we can see a lot of text, written in `rtcp{}` format. But they are missing something that the actual
flag might have, spaces, or underscores, so let's look for that and see what we get :

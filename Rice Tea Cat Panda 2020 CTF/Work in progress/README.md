## Description

I was asked to beta-test this game, but it's so incomplete, it's kind of doesn't even have a goal... The developer said there's a flag, though, so I guess I'll just leave you to it!

## Hint

Have you ever played Skyrim? Well, you don't need a horse for this one.

## Solving

Let's launch the executable and... oh ! It's a platform game ! Well, common sense would tell us to go directly right, but there is
nothing really important there, just a few unkillable goblins, so let's head straight left :

Continue this way, climb the glitchy tower :

We then just need to take a leap of faith to get the flag :

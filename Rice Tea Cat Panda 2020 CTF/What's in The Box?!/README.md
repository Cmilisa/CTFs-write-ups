## Hint 

You may drag it to your bookmarks bar ;D

## Solving

Let's listen to the hint and drag the box to our bookmarks bar. We then can right click on it, go into properties and get the javascript code that's supposed to be what the bookmark links to, and use some javascript beautifier on it :

We then simply get parts of the flag in comments on a few lines.
